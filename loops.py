# This is a example of a infinite loop
# Below is a While loop
# while True:
#     print('What would you like to do?')
#     response = input('>')

# Counter example
# counter = 0
# while counter < 10:
#     counter += 1
#     print(counter)

# Car Counter with numbered list
# cars = ['Ferrari', 'Fiat Panda', 'Fiat Panda 4*4', 'Skoda Felicia Fun']
# max_size_list = len(cars)
# counter = -1
# number = 1
# while counter < len(cars) -1:
#     counter += 1
#     print(str(number) + ' - ' + cars[counter]) can also be print number, cars[counter]
#     number += 1

# Break example
# while True:
#     user = input('Please type something').strip().capitalize()
#     if user == ('Exit'):
#         print('Thank you, Bye!')
#         break

#     elif user == 'Hi':
#         print('Hi to you!')
#     else:
